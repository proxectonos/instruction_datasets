# Instruction datasets

Collection of synthetic instruction datasets used during the instruction pretraining of Model-small-instr-1, Model-small-instr-2 and Model-small-instr-3.

## Dataset creation

Datasets were created using two different techniques:

- Adapting already existing datasets or corpora by modifying their format to make them suitable for the instruction pretraining. 
- Creating the dataset from scratch by using a LLM ([Salamandra-7B](https://huggingface.co/BSC-LT/salamandra-7b-instruct)) to generate diverse instructions based on existing data.

## Dataset information

The following table presents the basic information of each dataset.
